|------------|:--------:|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `HOSTNAME` |    âœ…     | localhost | Set this to your machine name so that the applications can work correctly |

To simplify the handling of environment variables, you can create a new .env file with the
command `cp .env.template .env` and executing the `applyHelmfile.sh` script.

Only this script will apply the variables set in `.env`!
